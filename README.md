This project focuses on cleaning and exploring the Superstore dataset using Python.
The goal is to prepare the data for further analysis in SQL Server and visualization in Power BI.

In this first step, the dataset is cleaned, date columns are converted, new features such as delivery time are created, and an exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to identify key business insights like unprofitable products and the impact of discounts.
